# MicroFlow Overview
The MicroFlow service aims to expedite and streamline the 
development of a microservice architecture.
## Documentation
For detailed documentation, refer to the 
[MicroFlow documentation](https://novokshanove.github.io/MicroFlow/docs/index.html).

## Main Objectives
### The primary objectives of MicroFlow include:
- Developing an architecture bottleneck tracking mechanism
- Implementing LLM to enhance the interaction experience
- Enabling real-time architecture development tracking and analysis for errors and shortcomings.


## Current Goals
### The current focus is on:
- Market analysis
- Conducting a survey among architects
- Choosing a technology stack for implementation
- Development of a graph-based error detection mechanism


## The operation of such a system:
1) Visually, all this will look like flowcharts, 
where each block will represent a service, and the 
connections between them will be interaction protocols.
2) All this will be analyzed based on the parameters 
that will be specified by the user. After the analysis, 
the system will show recommendations for improvement to 
improve the speed of work.
3) After the architecture is accepted for development, 
each block will be linked to a real service, and you can see 
the development progress on the timeline. Also, as the services are ready, 
the user will be able to add tests that will help re-analyze the 
stability of a particular service and their interaction.
If any problems are identified, solutions will be offered.
4) After the end of the development of all services, the system 
can be used to collect analytics on various metrics and 
monitor the performance of services."
