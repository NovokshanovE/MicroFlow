# MicroFlow

The MicroFlow service is being developed in order to speed up and simplify the 
development of a micro service architecture.


## Documentation

[docs](dokka/index.html)


#### Main objectives:

- Development of an architecture bottleneck tracking mechanism;
- Applying LLM to improve the interaction experience;
- The service should allow you to track the development of 
the architecture in real time, as well as analyze what 
is already available for errors and shortcomings;

#### The main goals now are:
- Choosing a programming language
- I am considering the possibility of writing an interface on flutter and a backend component on go
- An expensive option is to write a desktop application in Java.
